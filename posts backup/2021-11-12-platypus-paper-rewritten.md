This post contains a complete rewriting of the paper about platypuses and evolutionary immunology [originally published](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/29/10/3205/1030857) at *Molecular Ecology and Evolution*, and [also presented here with my annotations](https://jawws.org/blog/2021/10/07/platypus-annotated.html).

Due to formatting constraints with footnotes, this post is not available on the JAWWS website, but it can be read in full [here](https://etiennefd.com/dgm/platypus-paper-rewritten/).
