So if I can’t convince you that (1) economic growth is a moral imperative, (2) growing NYC is vital for that growth, and (3) that housing is the principal way to grow the city, I’ve lost the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore: here is a list of readings that make an excellent case for growth, NYC-growth, and housing-as-the-key-to-growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is divided into two parts. This first part has items that would take one-ish hours or less to read, and I recommend starting there. The second part is books, to be pursued at your more lengthy convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often advocacy groups have a “reading list” page that leaves the viewer with no idea of where to start, or why any particular item is actually important. If I fall into that trap, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; send me a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;housing-theory-of-everything&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/&quot;&gt;The Housing Theory of Everything&lt;/a&gt;” (2021, &lt;em&gt;Works in Progress&lt;/em&gt;) by Sam Bowman &amp;amp; John Myers &amp;amp; Ben Southwood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay explains how housing is connected to almost every other civic issue humans deal with—the environment, health, personal finance, job selection, and more. If we can produce more housing where people want to live, we’ll be richer, happier, and healthier. If we can’t, we’ll be poorer, sadder, and sicklier. From the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Try listing every problem the Western world has at the moment. Along with Covid, you might include slow growth, climate change, poor health, financial instability, economic inequality, and falling fertility. These longer-term trends contribute to a sense of malaise that many of us feel about our societies. They may seem loosely related, but there is one big thing that makes them all worse. That thing is a shortage of housing: too few homes being built where people want to live. And if we fix those shortages, we will help to solve many of the other, seemingly unrelated problems that we face as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;housing-constraints-and-spatial-misallocation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://eml.berkeley.edu//~moretti/growth.pdf&quot;&gt;Housing Constraints and Spatial Misallocation&lt;/a&gt;” (2019, &lt;em&gt;American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics&lt;/em&gt;) by Chang-Tai Hsieh &amp;amp; Enrico Moretti&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a technical economics paper, so there’s a bit of a learning curve if you’re not used to reading these. But it yields a stark, damning indictment of America’s inability to build housing, especially in high-demand areas like the Bay and NYC. The laws and individuals who actively block housing, and therefore block people from moving to higher-productivity areas, have made us all &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; poorer, and they will keep holding the entire country back until we change housing policy. From the paper’s abstract (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We quantify the amount of spatial misallocation of labor across US cities and its aggregate costs. Misallocation arises because high productivity cities like New York and the San Francisco Bay Area have adopted stringent restrictions to new housing supply, effectively limiting the number of workers who have access to such high productivity. &lt;strong&gt;Using a spatial equilibrium model and data from 220 metropolitan areas we find that these constraints lowered aggregate US growth by &lt;em&gt;36 percent&lt;/em&gt; from 1964 to 2009.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;curing-housing-scarcity&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Chapter 7: Curing Housing Scarcity” from Matt Yglesias’ &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger-ebook/dp/B082ZR6827/&quot;&gt;One Billion Americans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter surveys the diverse causes of America’s housing shortage and how they came to be. The two broad themes that I took from it are: (1) America is vast, and we can all live in different kinds of housing; there is no best way to live, and no one should force a certain kind of “ideal” housing everywhere, and (2) we know the solutions to the housing crisis. This is kind of good news—it isn’t a hard technical issue we have no idea how to solve. This is also kind of bad news—housing is a political issue that we, so far, can’t manage to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The key is that the technical aspects of fitting more people onto scarce land are not difficult—it’s a question of politics, and in particular the kinds of political entities that are empowered to make decisions” (202).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-so-great-about-skyscrapers&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Chapter 6: What’s So Great About Skyscrapers?” from Edward Glaeser’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-Healthier/dp/0143120549/&quot;&gt;Triumph of the City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2011)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter focuses heavily on New York City and how its inability to build housing arose. From onerous permitting and zoning regulations to abused historic preservation laws, misguided people have been throttling NYC for a long time—and using many of the same arguments for more than a century now! Looking back, we can see that many of their arguments are as wrong then as they are now. From the chapter, emphasis added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“New York’s upward trajectory was not without its detractors. In 1913, the distinguished chairman of the Fifth Avenue Commission, who was himself an architect, led a fight to ‘save Fifth Avenue from ruin.’ At the time, Fifth Avenue was still a street of stately mansions owned by Astors and Rockefellers. The antigrowth activists argued that unless heights were restricted to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;125 feet or less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Fifth Avenue would become a canyon with ruinous results for property values, congestion, and the city as a whole. Similar arguments have been made by the enemies of change throughout history and into our time” (142).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Part 2: Books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-billion-americans&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Yglesias’ &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger-ebook/dp/B082ZR6827/&quot;&gt;One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book contends that substantially increasing America’s population would be great across almost every domain you can think of, and it discusses what’s keeping us from that ten-digit goal. Growing our high-productivity areas (like New York City) is one of the keys to one billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stubborn-attachments&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyler Cowen’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135/&quot;&gt;Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2018)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cowen presents the moral case for growth, and (because I’m convinced by his reasoning) it strengthens my claim that growing NYC is not just good, it’s a moral imperative. From the book’s summary prior to its introduction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Growth is good. Through history, economic growth, in particular, has alleviated human misery, improved human happiness and opportunity, and lengthened human lives. Wealthier societies are more stable, offer better living standards, produce better medicines, and ensure greater autonomy, greater fulfillment, and more sources of fun. If we want to continue on our trend of growth, and the overwhelmingly positive outcomes for societies that come with it, every individual must become more concerned with the welfare of those around us. So how do we proceed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;triumph-of-the-city&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edward Glaeser’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-Healthier/dp/0143120549/&quot;&gt;Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2011)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glaeser explains how cities benefit humankind, how they’ve developed historically, how they can go wrong, and what we can do to make even better ones. This is especially important, because, as he says in the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Two hundred forty-three million Americans crowd together in the 3 percent of the country that is urban” (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think of this book as the extended version of “The Housing Theory of Everything” above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked some good lines from the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danielgolliher/status/1453440216086335491?s=20&quot;&gt;in this 40-tweet thread&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to get a quick survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;death-and-life&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, a note on Jane Jacobs’ &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities/dp/067974195X/&quot;&gt;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1961).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; book on American urbanism, and it’s widely referenced in any circle that’s concerned with cities or housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However! I wouldn’t recommend it as a starting point if your goal is to get a handle on ideas about the nature of cities, growth, and housing. I would start with the books and articles mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because Jacobs goes into extraordinary detail, block by block, analyzing the built environment of various cities, especially New York. If you haven’t lived in these cities or thought about the discrete elements of urbanism much before, it can be hard to keep track of the broader principles she’s exploring via such granularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this book is a gem, and well worth reading after you’ve gotten your feet wet. The rhetorical skill alone makes it a pure joy, and Jacobs has an irresistible personality that comes through clearly in her writing. Despite some things I think she got wrong, her approach to observing the complexity of a city is spot-on—from the introduction of &lt;em&gt;Death and Life&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So in this book we shall start, if only in a small way, adventuring in the real world, ourselves. The way to get at what goes on in the seemingly mysterious and perverse behavior of cities is, I think, to look closely, and with as little previous expectation as is possible, at the most ordinary scenes and events, and attempt to see what they mean and whether any threads of principle emerge among them” (13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximum New York is a new civic organization and philosophy. It recognizes that sustainable growth far beyond New York City’s current size is the key to addressing its civic issues and unlocking vast amounts of new wealth and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem: most people think New York City is beyond help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might not say it like that, but their actions show that they’ve accepted a middling version of New York. The best and brightest have forsaken the polity, and if this problem is not solved, the vision of Maximum New York cannot be—so that’s where I’ll start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve fallen in love with New York City, you’ve wondered about “getting involved.” You want to deploy your talents, intelligence, and resources in service of the common good. Whether this means participating in city government or working with a civic organization, you want to learn how to make the city a better place. After all, the city faces problems—many with obvious and well-known solutions. You can give the system the push it needs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, after some investigation, you’re mired in twin demoralizing realities. First: NYC’s civic structure is inscrutable to anyone not already familiar with it, and there is no obvious way for you to learn about it. You’re just sitting in your apartment at 1AM, closing your laptop after a futile attempt to learn basic city politics. You, who have met life’s challenges; you, who sustain yourself in the face of doubt and trial; you, who solve complex problems in your work; you, who are any go-getter with a library card and internet connection—you have been defeated. And by what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: if you manage to touch some part of civic order itself, you see how it frustrates anyone with technical prowess and a can-do attitude. Quite understandably, you think some version of “fuck this, why waste my time,” and you contribute your time and energy to the private sector and your private life. You accept the compounding drag on private efforts that a failing polity produces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Leviathan shrugs. The exodus and deterrence of talent from our government and civic structure continues. The negative feedback loop takes another lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cannot continue, of course, or else we’ll meet our doom. Worse yet, we’ll languish in the shadow of what could have been. Seeing the reality of our city, we’ll know that the future could have been ours, in our own time. And if that future does not arrive, citizens, it will be our fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK then, the problem is clear: for understandable (but regrettable) reasons, potentially excellent citizens do not, or cannot, engage with New York City. And by their withholding, we all suffer compounding loss and opportunity cost at a societal level. That concludes the grim portion of this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what are you gonna do about it, and why is it Maximum New York?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution: Maximum New York&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MNY (Maximum New York) is three things: a civics institution, a game, and a set of ideas. And so it has three corresponding goals: (1) train talent to enter the civic sphere, (2) make it as enjoyable as learning any other worthwhile skill, and (3) deploy that talent in the service of human capacity and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the first two aspects of MNY, as a &lt;strong&gt;training ground&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;game&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entering New York City civics is hard because it’s not an entry-level activity, even though it’s culturally presented like one. Would you try to bench press twice your bodyweight on day one of your strength regimen? Would you try to read Dostoevsky in Russian after one Duolingo lesson? Of course not. You’d be missing too many skills, and you’d only end up frustrated and defeated if you tried. Does that situation sound familiar—perhaps from a few paragraphs ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cultivate almost any skill requires solidifying the basics, sustained effort over a long period of time, and (ideally) guidance from a more advanced practitioner. For muscles, you have a trainer. For languages, you have a tutor. And for NYC civics, you have me and Maximum New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do I offer an &lt;a href=&quot;/new-york-city-onboarding&quot;&gt;NYC onboarding&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll also be starting the &lt;strong&gt;Maximum New York Council&lt;/strong&gt; in Q1 of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MNY Council will be a legislative body of 20-60 individuals from across the city who will consider and pass bills and resolutions. The Council will have a budget supplied by MNY that will grow over time with the institution, as its members gain institutional sophistication and ambition. We’re playing with live ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what will the Council &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;? That’s up for its members to decide, in accordance with the general vision of MNY. The whole point of the Council is to train ambitious, intelligent people to improve New York’s civic structure by first giving them live experience with the mechanics of &lt;em&gt;governance&lt;/em&gt;. To be successful they will need to acquire detailed local knowledge, and learn to wield procedural rules. Together with their fellow council members, they will draft and pass legislation allocating the organization’s resources (financial and human) to achieve their ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they want to sponsor a trash can on a city block. Perhaps they want to commission a statue. Perhaps they want to form a partnership with another organization, or part of the government. And perhaps they want to scale the organization’s ambitions far beyond any of those things. It’s up to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds appealing to you, but you don’t know how to participate in such an organization, you will be taught. For the first year or two (as needed), I will be serving as the organization’s first executive. I will interview, prep, and appoint each member of the Council. All I ask is that potential members arm themselves with curiosity, mental toughness, and a positive attitude. Governance is a learned skill just like anything else. Sophistication will come to those who work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Council reaches milestones, its sophistication will increase. The first major change will be the introduction of a Council Speaker, who will preside over the body. And after the first year or two of the Council’s existence, I will step out of the executive role, leaving it to be filled via majority vote of the Council from among its members. At this point, there’s no telling where things will go. But serving a term on the Maximum New York Council will become a recognized public achievement, and a thorough preparation for further civic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is governance as a game. Like the game of life, there are a few hard constraints, but otherwise it’s open-ended. If you think you’d like to try your hand at it, follow me and MNY. Further details, including eligibility and application requirements, will be forthcoming—as will other governance games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s turn to the ideology of Maximum New York, which is also the guiding vision of the MNY Council—the cardinal direction of its policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ideology&quot;&gt;The Ideology: Let New York Grow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a political ideology (a system of ideas about how to properly arrange the social order). The ideas are either coherent or not, owned or borrowed, intentional or ad hoc. MNY is animated by mine, which I’ll sum up now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum New York in a nutshell: the idea that large, sustainable growth is vital for the future of New York City and the world that it exists within, and that the absence of this growth causes and will cause massive societal harm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a strong contention that would require a short book for minimum viable justification; rest assured, that book is coming. But for now, the summary review of MNY is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maximizing sustainable economic growth is a moral imperative, because it radically increases human wealth and well-being in a compounding fashion over time. A relevant passage from Tyler Cowen’s book &lt;em&gt;Stubborn Attachments&lt;/em&gt;: “…redo U.S. history, but assume the country’s economy had grown one percentage point less each year between 1870 and 1990. In that scenario, the United States of 1990 would be no richer than the Mexico of 1990.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A principal component of this is maximizing the sustainable economic growth of New York City, because a larger NYC means radically more wealth and well-being for the city, the state, the country, and the world. The city can, and should, grow well past 10 million, and sooner than we think. There is room.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NYC’s primary growth and well-being inhibitors are city and state laws that illegalize the vast majority of potential new housing. In the best case scenario, they merely raise the price of, reduce, and delay the small amount of potential housing they allow to become actual.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore: one of the most high-impact and pressing endeavors of our time is striking these laws from the books and legalizing the production of new housing in New York. People should start saying things like “one million new units within a decade.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are many people who’ve been working on housing in NYC, and they’ve made important progress. But Maximum New York is distinct in its underlying philosophy, strategy, and tactics, and fills a rhetorical and political space that’s been vacant in the city.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New York’s civic culture needs more optimism, more grand visions of the future, and more people who take seriously the idea that their city should be &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;. We’re kept from the future not just by broken institutions, but by a lack of people rushing in to fix them. This vision is no mere window dressing; it is vital to pulling the future forward.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-me&quot;&gt;Join Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future will not happen on its own. If you are a private citizen of ability and interest, consider what you and your contemporaries withdrawing your talents from the polity means for its future—and whether you endorse that outcome. If you do not, join me and support Maximum New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year will be the start of a grand experiment in civics, and the template for others like it. If you aren’t convinced of MNY’s potential, I remind you that while people often overestimate what can be done in a year, they radically underestimate what can be done in a decade. But you must start &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;. That somewhere is right here, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gotham is calling us, citizens, and we haven’t a second to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I claim that sustainable economic growth is a moral imperative&lt;/strong&gt;, and that it radically increases wealth and well-being over time. For a summary overview of the arguments behind this contention, see Tyler Cowen’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2018 by Stripe Press. A relevant passage: “…redo U.S. history, but assume the country’s economy had grown one percentage point less each year between 1870 and 1990. In that scenario, the United States of 1990 would be no richer than the Mexico of 1990” (40). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For an overview of why growing the city would send positive ripples so broadly, and why housing sits at its heart, see “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/&quot;&gt;The Housing Theory of Everything&lt;/a&gt;” from &lt;em&gt;Works in Progress&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for the million units of housing and Maximum New York’s view of the future&lt;/strong&gt;…for now I’ll just say that the time has come to set better goals for New York City—not just governmentally, but culturally. “One million housing units” is out of every politician’s frame of reference, so I’m sure most of them would call it impossible—and it may well be! But there is value in boldness, properly conceived. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you become a New Yorker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author and journalist Tom Wolfe said, “One belongs to New York instantly, one belongs to it as much in five minutes as in five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you feel unconnected to the city, regardless of how long you’ve been here (but especially if you’re a new arrival), that idea isn’t terribly helpful, even if it is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m conducting a New York onboarding program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://6d25o04x7o3.typeform.com/to/ZgRpzkiu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/onboarding-enroll-button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enroll in onboarding!&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-deliberately-become-a-new-yorker&quot;&gt;How do you deliberately become a New Yorker?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every person ultimately does this in their own way, but there are things you can do to give you a good start—this act of becoming is not so different than any act of skill acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yashkaf&quot;&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt; put it in his recent essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://putanumonit.com/2021/09/10/rules-for-noobs/&quot;&gt;“Rules for Noobs”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here’s a general model I propose of how people learn most skills:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At first, you can neither perform the skill or discriminate between good and bad performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You learn concepts that allow you to discriminate, and explicit rules to guide your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As you keep improving, you recognize more and more rules even as the first ones you learned become intuitive and natural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At some point, your intuitive model is rich enough that imposing additional rules on top of it decreases performance, and you should stop consciously applying rules and do what is natural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start with explicit rules that allow you to eventually build your own intuitive understanding. It’s like any well-constructed 101-course syllabus: you might not know why everything is on it at the beginning of the term, but by semester’s end you should see how it all comes together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve put together a syllabus of becoming. A New York 101. I’m Daniel from HR, and I’m here to onboard you to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-new-york-onboarding&quot;&gt;What is a New York onboarding?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what it isn’t: a list of events happening in the city, or a feed of popular venues. Those are valuable, but in the end most of them only tell you how to consume NYC, not become it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My New York onboarding introduces you to the built environment of the city—its places and its infrastructure; its government; and its institutions. You will encounter fun things during your onboarding, and you will (probably) meet cool people. But those experiences will be nested within a larger integrated urban introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things you’ll need to do to complete your New York onboarding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-youll-go&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where you’ll go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to a destination in all five boroughs of the city (park, restaurant, neighborhood walk, almost anything)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Manhattan&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Staten Island&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Bronx&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Queens&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attend a show. A busker in Central Park, Broadway, or anything in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-youll-get-there&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you’ll get there&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ride a bus four times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ride a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citibikenyc.com/homepage&quot;&gt;Citi Bike&lt;/a&gt; (or your own) four times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ride the subway four times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a ferry at least once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-youll-learn&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read a book about NYC (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ny.curbed.com/2017/11/22/16682062/best-new-york-books-black-friday-cyber-monday&quot;&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; for some starting points). Or, alternatively, listen to a podcast series or consume some other media about the city. If possible, get the book/media by checking it out of the New York Public Library (which means you’d need to get a library card too).
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Read an NYC book&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Potentially: get a library card!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick three NYC-centric blogs, publications, or Twitter accounts to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Report something to &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.311.nyc.gov/&quot;&gt;311&lt;/a&gt;, New York’s non-emergency service line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-youll-know&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you’ll know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Join a civic organization (a club, a music group, a sports league, a house of worship, a regular meetup, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attend at least one meeting of your local &lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cau/community-boards/community-boards.page&quot;&gt;community board&lt;/a&gt;. (You can do this via Zoom.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email your &lt;a href=&quot;https://council.nyc.gov/districts/&quot;&gt;city council representative&lt;/a&gt; to introduce yourself as a constituent. You can tell them you’re emailing as part of your onboarding process and link to &lt;a href=&quot;/new-york-city-onboarding&quot;&gt;this essay&lt;/a&gt;, or make your own short introduction. I suggest a few sentences about why you came to New York and how long you’ve been here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not know what everything on this list is, why it’s important, or how do it. You might not even like everything on it. That’s OK. That’s why the whole process begins with an onboarding call with me (see the end of the essay for the signup). I’ll walk you through the list, and together we can decide how you’ll complete it over the course of about a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you complete the onboarding, you will receive a diploma that I will personally sign and emboss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-who-am-i&quot;&gt;But who am I?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Daniel Golliher. If you don’t know me, you can get a one-sided introduction via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danielgolliher&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielgolliher.com&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up on a farm in Indiana; attended Harvard College and studied political philosophy; spent a lot of my time learning that I didn’t want to be a lawyer; and I’ve lived as an adult in Cincinnati, Cambridge/Boston, and New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play the piano and saxophone, I write things on the internet, and I have a non-traditional path through the world of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved to New York City almost three years ago because I wanted to—easier said than done, but that’s why I did it. I chose it deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I can’t help but learn more about the city all the time. I took my first stab at understanding the city government by &lt;a href=&quot;https://golliher.substack.com/p/understanding-nycs-government&quot;&gt;mapping out the city charter in Roam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get started!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://6d25o04x7o3.typeform.com/to/ZgRpzkiu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/onboarding-enroll-button.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enroll in onboarding!&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will email you to set up a meeting online or in person, and we will make a plan for you to complete the onboarding checklist in about a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you complete the plan, you will receive the aforementioned diploma, which will be very cute. I can mail it to you, or we can meet in person for a tiny graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note on cost: your calls with me do not cost anything. The only thing you’ll have to pay for are the items on the checklist—and most of that is just the cost of public transportation. You can make this as expensive as you want, or not, and I estimate that the cheapest version of the onboarding would cost about $40 (although it could be cheaper if you’ve already paid for some public transport in the form of, say, a 30-day unlimited MetroCard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to meeting you, and the city looks forward to welcoming new citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Golliher</name><email>daniel@maximumnewyork.com</email></author><summary type="html">The original version of this essay appeared in my personal Substack here.</summary></entry></feed>
