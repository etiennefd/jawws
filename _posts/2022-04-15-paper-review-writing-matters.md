Is it useful to care about the quality of the writing in an academic paper?

The answer seems obvious, but remember: academic papers aren't written primarily to communicate ideas. They're written for the purpose of being accepted at a conference or journal so that you can add them to your academic CV. So, does the quality of your writing increases the odds of being accepted by referees, editors, and conference committees? This is the question studied by Feld et al. in their March 2022 paper "[Writing matters](https://janfeld.weebly.com/uploads/1/1/8/9/118933153/writing_matters.pdf)."

Jan Feld is an economist in New Zealand. The two coauthors, Corinna Lines and Libby Ross, are professional "plain language" consultants. They devised an experiment that consisted of getting unpublished papers from economics PhD students, creating a professionally edited version of each, and asking a bunch of economists and writing experts to rate the quality of a random sample of unedited and edited papers. 

The results: Writing experts thoughts that the professionally edited papers were written better, and the economists thought that the professionally edited papers were more likely to be reviewed positively and accepted at conferences and journals. So, writing matters! But by how much?

The [Flesch-Kincaid grade level score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) estimates what school grade a reader should have to be able to understand a paper. The original, unedited papers had an average score of 15.3 for their introductions (meaning you should be above "grade 15," so undergraduate level); the edited introductions had an average of 14.7. The chances of accepting a paper for a conference or good journal, according to the economists, were 8.4% higher and 4.1% respectively. Not too surprisingly, these numbers were higher when the unedited version was rated as poorly written. 

How convincing are these results? An improvement in the Flesch-Kincaid score of less than a year of education doesn't sound that amazing, and the 1-digit percentage improvements in acceptance rate aren't mindblowing either. But the authors do conclude that writing matters. They suggest that it would be a good philanthropy cause to offer free professional editing to researchers, especially non-native speakers of English. I think this comes from a logic of "every little bit counts." Publishing papers in the right places is so important to a scientist's career, and outside their control for the most part, so you should make sure that each part that you *do* control is done well.

An obvious limitation is that this study looked at the effect of *professional editing*. Professional editing is done by people who are not economists and who will rarely use much creativity in their work — since creativity should stem from the intentions of the original authors. I suspect that this results in papers that avoid the worst, but are also boring and not too interesting. The paper "Writing matters" itself, although clear and fairly easy to read, is rather drab. 

On the bright side, this also means that the editing intervention may be scalable, since it is fairly standardized. It also takes into account the scarcity of professional work time: the editors were instructed to spend a reasonable amount of time on any paper, and the total per paper ended up around 6 hours. The authors wrote guidelines emphasizing that most work should be devoted to the title, abstract, and introduction, which are the parts with the highest impact. Any editing done on the rest of the paper should aim at optimizing *skimming*, which I like. Few people do more than skimming the methods and results of an academic paper, especially when they need to quickly decide on acceptance or rejection.

The authors published their guidelines in an appendix. They're pretty good and worth reading. Here is the general outline of the editing process from the appendix:

> The goal is to edit the paper so that an expert who has 10 minutes to evaluate the paper will understand it more easily. We’ll focus on improving the title, abstract, and introduction using these guidelines. For the rest of the paper, we’ll focus on making the paper easier to skim read. We’ll prioritise what we edit based on what (in our experience) will best help the reader easily understand the paper while skim reading. We’ll edit for readers who can comfortably read academic documents, but who aren’t familiar with the discipline of economics.

> If the writing is very poor, we’ll rewrite some parts instead of editing.

> There are many good reasons we’ll deviate from these guidelines: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. If we’re unsure, we’ll ask the writer. 

> To save time, we may outsource some tasks to the writers. For example, we might ask them to round all numbers in a table to 2 decimal points. 

This is all very reasonable.
