## Reading
### Literature on science publishing
- [The readability of scientific texts is decreasing over time](https://elifesciences.org/articles/27725). This 2017 study analyzed 700,000 abstracts from the past 140 years and concluded that readability, as measured by standard formulas using things like number of words per sentence and use of jargon, has steadily decreased.
- [You have to read this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01221-6). A 2021 comment in *Nature Human Behaviour* arguing that narrative writing should be used in science papers.
- [Does it take too long to publish research?](https://www.nature.com/articles/530148a) From the news section of *Nature* in 2016.

### Style guides
- [Nonfiction Writing Advice](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/) from Scott Alexander. Not intended for science necessarily, but very useful in any case.
- [Formatting guide](https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide) for the journal *Nature*, useful as an example of what is seen as the best guidelines for a top journal.

### Examples of well-written papers

### Crypto and Web3
- [Magna Carta Scientiae](https://atoms.org/scientiae), a detailed description of the current problems in science and how Ethereum smart contracts could help.
- [Tokenized Thoughts](https://0xboodle.substack.com/p/tokenized-thought), on various ways crypto could help academic science.

### Other articles

### Interesting publishing platforms and journals

### General science improvement
- [New Science](https://newscience.org/), founded by Alexey Guzey, seeks to establish new models of funding and organizing the institutions of science. They have generously funded me to work on JAWWS for a few months.
