New York City must grow. 

MNY (Maximum New York) is three things: a civics institution, a game, and a set of ideas. And so it has three corresponding goals: (1) train talent to enter the civic sphere, (2) make it as enjoyable as learning any other worthwhile skill, and (3) deploy that talent in the service of human capacity and well-being by growing New York City. 

Sustainable growth far beyond New York City's current size is the key to addressing its civic issues and unlocking vast amounts of new wealth and well-being.

America needs visible aspiration; let us revive the great dream of New York City.

## Background

Founder: [Daniel Golliher](https://twitter.com/danielgolliher/)

MNY's roots stretch to early 2019, when Daniel thought, "I'd like to learn the structure of NYC's government." That one project quickly became many (and included producing [a map of the NYC charter](https://golliher.substack.com/p/understanding-nycs-government)), and his desire to understand the mechanisms of the city merged with his hope for its future. The result in 2021 is a new civic philosophy, and an organization to house it.
