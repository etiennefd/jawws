Scientific papers are too difficult to read. There is no good reason for this. Yes, science can be technical and complex, but it does not justify the long paragraphs, the abundance of abbreviations, the jargon, the unwieldy paper structure.

The Journal of Accessible and Well-Written Science (JAWWS) seeks to change this. We want to promote better writing norms by publishing highly readable science papers, both old and new. Ultimately, we hope to make it easier for scientists to communicate among themselves, and for the public to gain better access to the primary sources of science without needing a layer of science communicators to "translate" science.

## Background

This project was imagined by [Étienne Fortier-Dubois](https://etiennefd.com) in the summer of 2021. Étienne used to be on track for a career as an academic in evolutionary biology, but decided to quit after his master's degree in 2016.

## Contact and Support

For now, the best way to contact us is to write a message to [Étienne on Twitter](https://twitter.com/etiennefd/). 

JAWWS has received support from [New Science](https://newscience.org/) and began during a residency at [Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/). We will set up new options to receive support soon.
