Are you a scientist currently trying to get your research published? **JAWWS is interested in helping you edit your manuscript.**

We'll help you make sure your paper is highly readable while respecting the constraints of the journal(s) where you intend to submit it. 

For now, and for a limited time, **this service is free**! As part of our research into the science publishing world, we want to gain an understanding of the real-life problems encountered by scientists when dealing with journals. We also want to develop our expertise in science editing. Later down the line, we will most likely establish a paid service.

Contact [hello@jawws.org](https://jawws.org/blog/) if you're interested.
